//Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-patterns

1. Unnecessary Filtering in `useMemo`:

- The code filters balances and checks the priority and amount twice. This can be streamlined by combining the conditions.
- The initial check `if (lhsPriority > -99) { if (balance.amount <= 0) { return true; } }` seems incorrect because it retains balances with `amount <= 0`, which might not be the intended behavior.


2. Incorrect Logical Condition in `useMemo`:

- The condition `if (lhsPriority > -99) { if (balance.amount <= 0) { return true; } }` should likely be `if (lhsPriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0)` to retain positive balances.


3. `useMemo` Dependencies:

The dependency array for `useMemo` includes `prices`, but the sorting only depends on balances. Including prices could cause unnecessary recomputations.


4. Separate Mapping for Formatting:

- Mapping `sortedBalances` to `formattedBalances` and then separately mapping to `rows` results in iterating over the balances multiple times. This can be combined into a single step.


5. Calculation of USD Value:

- The calculation of `usdValue` should ensure the existence of `prices[balance.currency]` to prevent potential `undefined` multiplications.


6. TypeScript Typing and Data Access:

`blockchain` is accessed in `getPriority` but isn't a property of `WalletBalance` in the provided interfaces. This should be corrected or the interface should be updated.
